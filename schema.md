# Lightspeed — Database Schema

**Canonical reference for the SQLite schema.** Source of truth is `db.py`
(the `SCHEMA` string); this file mirrors it in human-readable form.

> ⚠️ **Keep this current.** Any change to the schema in `db.py` (new table,
> column, constraint, enum value, or migration) MUST be reflected here in the
> same change. See CLAUDE.md.

## Tables

### `batch`
One generation set (one prompt → many problems). The provenance + type/grouping unit.

| column      | type | notes                                   |
|-------------|------|-----------------------------------------|
| id          | INTEGER PK | |
| prompt      | TEXT NOT NULL | the description that generated the set |
| created_at  | TEXT NOT NULL | ISO-8601 UTC |

### `problem`
A single problem, stored **decomposed** into labeled parts. Belongs to a batch;
lifecycle controlled by `status`. Every non-empty `formula_*` / `expression_*`
renders as its own math block (own copy button on the run page); empty fields are
not displayed.

| column             | type | notes                                              |
|--------------------|------|----------------------------------------------------|
| id                 | INTEGER PK | |
| batch_id           | INTEGER FK → batch(id) | |
| instructions       | TEXT NOT NULL | prose ask ("differentiate", "find the critical points"); may rarely carry LaTeX (e.g. "let X∼Exp(λ)") |
| formula_1          | TEXT | definition/given, raw TeX (e.g. `f(x)=…`, `X∼Dist`, a density + support). NULL when unused |
| formula_2          | TEXT | as above |
| formula_3          | TEXT | as above |
| expression_1       | TEXT | the operand the instruction acts on, raw TeX (`∫…dx`, the function, `E[X²]`). NULL when unused |
| expression_2       | TEXT | as above |
| expression_3       | TEXT | as above |
| answer             | TEXT NOT NULL | raw TeX; sympy output |
| answer_verified_by | TEXT | `NULL` = unverified; `'sympy'` = sympy-confirmed |
| problem_source     | TEXT NOT NULL | e.g. `claude` |
| answer_source      | TEXT NOT NULL | e.g. `sympy` |
| status             | TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'staged' | enum: `staged` \| `approved` \| `rejected` |
| created_at         | TEXT NOT NULL | ISO-8601 UTC |
| approved_at        | TEXT | set when status → approved; else NULL |

### `type`
A registered problem type — the guardrail binding a type's name to the generator
that produces it and its canonical instruction. Seeded on use at staging time
from the `problem_types.TYPES` registry (mirrors `TYPES.md`).

| column              | type | notes |
|---------------------|------|-------|
| id                  | INTEGER PK | |
| name                | TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE | e.g. `critical_points` |
| generator           | TEXT | the generator function in `problem_types.py` |
| default_instruction | TEXT | the type's canonical instruction; NULL for theme types that span generators |

### `problem_type`
Join table: which types apply to which problems. Types are applied **per batch**
(every problem in a batch gets the batch's type). Batches are **monotype**, so in
practice this is one type per problem, but the relation is M:N for flexibility.

| column     | type | notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| problem_id | INTEGER FK → problem(id) | part of composite PK |
| type_id    | INTEGER FK → type(id)    | part of composite PK |
| _PK_       | (problem_id, type_id) | |

### `problem_set`
A set of problems run together. Every problem is timed (no timed/untimed split).

| column           | type | notes |
|------------------|------|-------|
| id               | INTEGER PK | |
| n_attempts       | INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 | filled on finalize |
| n_correct        | INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 | filled on finalize |
| finish_time      | REAL | total seconds across the set; set at finalize |
| time_per_problem | REAL | average seconds; set at finalize |
| created_at       | TEXT NOT NULL | ISO-8601 UTC |

### `attempt`
One attempt at one problem, within a problem_set. Recorded for **every** problem
in the set (each carries its own time), graded or not.

| column              | type | notes |
|---------------------|------|-------|
| id                  | INTEGER PK | |
| problem_set_id      | INTEGER NOT NULL FK → problem_set(id) | |
| problem_id          | INTEGER NOT NULL FK → problem(id) | |
| n_previous_attempts | INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 | count of prior attempts at this problem |
| duration_seconds    | REAL | time spent on this problem (recorded when "next" was clicked) |
| completed_at        | TEXT NOT NULL | ISO-8601 UTC |
| answered_correctly  | INTEGER | `1` correct, `0` incorrect, `NULL` ungraded |

## Relationships

```
batch 1──* problem *──* type        (via problem_type; applied batch-level, monotype)
problem 1──* attempt
problem_set 1──* attempt
```

- A **batch** has many **problems**; a problem belongs to exactly one batch.
- A **problem** has many **types** and a **type** has many problems (M:N via
  `problem_type`). In practice the batch is monotype, so it is one type per problem.
- A **problem_set** has many **attempts**; each **attempt** also points at the
  single **problem** it recorded.

## Enumerations & conventions

- `problem.status`: `staged` (just generated, awaiting review) → `approved`
  (in the bank) | `rejected` (discarded). Only `approved` problems are eligible
  for the bank/sets.
- `answer_verified_by = 'sympy'` means sympy confirmed the answer (`diff(answer) ==
  integrand`, plus FTC cross-check for definite integrals, etc.); never weaker. `NULL` = unverified.
- Dedup key is the tuple of the decomposed statement fields (`instructions` +
  `formula_1..3` + `expression_1..3`), exact match, checked at generation time
  against all problems regardless of status.
- All timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC strings (`db.now()`).

## Migrations

`db.init_db()` creates the schema (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`) and is otherwise
a no-op — there are currently no incremental migrations. `lightspeed.db` is
disposable (recreated on first run); it was rebuilt for the problem-decomposition
+ types change rather than migrated in place.
